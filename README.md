# 🏥 Medicare – Online Healthcare Communication Platform

Medicare is my project work where I built a full-stack healthcare web application that enables seamless interaction between patients and doctors. This platform allows patients to connect with medical professionals, manage their health records, and receive consultations remotely, while doctors can prescribe treatments, schedule appointments, and follow up with patients—all from one place.
